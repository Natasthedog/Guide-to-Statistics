#Your first step to being a Data Scientist:

In order to begin with Data Science, you need to understand the kind of data you are dealing with.
A good point to start is to study the Theory of Statistics and Multivariate Distribution Theory. This will allow you to have an informed and ethical approach to statistics and Data Science in general. If this is not the approach you took, fret not. I have studied it on your behalf and will guide you through to achieving amazing results with all kinds of data and statistics related questions.

When presented with a large quantity of data, the very first thing any scientist will want to know is how the data is distributed. This means, the way your data is arranged when thoughtfully ordered into categories. Now, there is a science behind this too. This is referred to as the discipline of Data Binning.

Luckily for you, the app we will build will first and foremost take us through data binning, and thereafter we will do descriptive statistics and all the other fun things like Machine Learning!

Below I outline the Statistical Process. This is something you will not be able to find on Google at all.

#The Statistical Process:

Despite spending years studying the subject, many do not know quite exactly how to approach statistics.

I will provide a guide here that is nearly full-proof to follow, lightweight and easy to implement.

##Process

The statistical process is a systematic approach to collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It involves several steps, including:

* Defining the research question or hypothesis: The first step in the statistical process is to define the research question or hypothesis that you are trying to address. This helps to clarify the purpose of the study and the specific information that you are trying to gather.

* Designing the study: Once you have defined your research question or hypothesis, you need to design a study that will allow you to collect the data you need to answer your question. This may involve selecting a sample of subjects, deciding on the variables you will measure, and developing a data collection plan.

* Collecting the data: The next step is to collect the data. This may involve conducting experiments, surveys, or other types of research. It is important to ensure that the data is collected accurately and reliably.

* Analyzing the data: Once you have collected the data, you need to analyze it to determine what it means. This may involve using statistical techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data.

* Interpreting the results: After analyzing the data, you need to interpret the results to determine what they mean in the context of your research question or hypothesis.

* Presenting the results: Finally, you need to present the results of your study in a clear and concise manner. This may involve writing a report or paper, or presenting the results in a graphical or visual form. When presenting your fidnings to your superior, never have more than 5 slides. 

The statistical process is a critical tool for understanding and interpreting data, and is widely used in a variety of fields including business, economics, psychology, and the natural and social sciences.
