#The Statistical Process:

Despite spending years studying the subject, many do not know quite exactly how to approach statistics.

I will provide a guide here that is nearly full-proof to follow, lightweight and easy to implement.

##Process

The statistical process is a systematic approach to collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It involves several steps, including:

* Defining the research question or hypothesis: The first step in the statistical process is to define the research question or hypothesis that you are trying to address. This helps to clarify the purpose of the study and the specific information that you are trying to gather.

* Designing the study: Once you have defined your research question or hypothesis, you need to design a study that will allow you to collect the data you need to answer your question. This may involve selecting a sample of subjects, deciding on the variables you will measure, and developing a data collection plan.

* Collecting the data: The next step is to collect the data. This may involve conducting experiments, surveys, or other types of research. It is important to ensure that the data is collected accurately and reliably.

* Analyzing the data: Once you have collected the data, you need to analyze it to determine what it means. This may involve using statistical techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data.

* Interpreting the results: After analyzing the data, you need to interpret the results to determine what they mean in the context of your research question or hypothesis.

* Presenting the results: Finally, you need to present the results of your study in a clear and concise manner. This may involve writing a report or paper, or presenting the results in a graphical or visual form. When presenting your fidnings to your superior, never have more than 5 slides. 

The statistical process is a critical tool for understanding and interpreting data, and is widely used in a variety of fields including business, economics, psychology, and the natural and social sciences.
